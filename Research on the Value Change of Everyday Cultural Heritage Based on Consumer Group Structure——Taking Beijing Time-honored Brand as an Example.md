# Research on the Value Change of Everyday Cultural Heritage Based on Consumer Group Structure——Taking Beijing Time-honored Brand as an Example

Wenhan Wei, Kangfu Zhuo, Liyun Huang

Abstract:
Urban cultural heritage is facing various challenges, and its everydayness has also been impacted. In order to better understand and protect the daily cultural heritage, we propose a method to quantitatively understand the daily cultural heritage based on public comment data. By constructing and visualizing the structure of consumers, and vitality mechanism are studied. Taking Beijing's time-honored brand as an example, the change of everydayness and popularity of the cultural heritage is revealed. And we find out the relationship between everydayness index and popularity. The everydayness of the time-honored brand has changed greatly, and different types of the time-honored brand have been different in changes; the spatial distribution of the time-honored brand's show different distributions and classified into 4 types in 18 areas: high popularity and high everydayness, high popularity and low everydayness, low popularity and low everydayness and low popularity and high everydayness. There are also differences in everydayness in each area. By analyzing its relationship with the hot spots and commercial districts, it is found that the old brands are distributed near to the commercial districts and alternative with the hot tourist spots. In some areas, the distribution of everydayness is negatively correlated with the hot tourist spots and commercial districts.



\1. Introduction
In the context of urbanization, the "adaptability" and "authenticity" of urban cultural heritage are facing huge challenges. In the process of adaptation, the daily cultural heritage exhibits more prominent characteristics such as "net redness", "commercialization" or "marginalization", and its daily nature changes or is even lost. The daily protection and inheritance of these cultural landscapes has become an important issue in the field of cultural heritage.
China Time-honored Brand is a veteran enterprise in mainland China selected by the former Ministry of Internal Trade of the People's Republic of China. It has products, skills or services inherited from generation to generation. It has a distinct traditional Chinese cultural background, profound cultural heritage and Broad sense of social identity. At the same time, most of the old brands are directly related to daily life through the corresponding material space. "Urban memory" is the old value of the old brand originating from historical development, reflected in local daily habits. In the face of tremendous changes in the market, established brands have also continuously adjusted their commercial value and positioning. With the prevalence of cultural travel and other phenomena, "city card" has gradually become a new label of "old brand" and has become a major part of its current value. The change in consumer structure is the result of the combined effect of past and present values. How are they balanced? Therefore, exploring the status quo and changes of consumer structure is an important part of studying everyday cultural heritage.
Dianping.com is the earliest established third-party review platform in China, which started in April 2003. Public comment is a consumer-based user review platform, and the daily nature of the time-honored brand is also mainly reflected in the user's consumption activities. We can measure people's consumption activities through public comments, thereby establishing the relationship between consumption activities and daily nature. Although different types such as catering and retail may have different reviews, this does not prevent us from using public comments to analyze their overall trends and user structure characteristics. There have been many studies to analyze the value of cultural heritage from the perspective of tourists and locals. The use of cultural heritage by locals reflects the daily nature of cultural heritage, while the interaction between tourists and cultural heritage more reflects the value of their city cards. The comments of the public comment all carry user information. Through the proportion of local users in the total number of comments, we can make a quantitative description of the daily nature of cultural heritage.
Therefore, this article proposes a way to quantitatively study daily cultural heritage based on public comment data, visualize the structure of consumer groups, and further describe and explore its vitality mechanism. The article takes Beijing's time-honored brand as an example for specific research and analysis. The specific research questions are:
(1) What changes have taken place in the consumer structure of established brands in Beijing?
(2) The spatial distribution characteristics of Beijing's established consumer structure?
(3) Classification and discussion of Beijing time-honored brands



\2. Literature review
Heritage has always been understood as a social process. In this process, local stakeholders have cultivated a sense of place (Gravari-Barbas) in the local identity construction method. With the development of the market and the protection of cultural heritage, the connection between "heritage" and "tourism" has gradually become closer. Since the late 1990s, people have paid more and more attention to studying the consumption relationship between people and heritage. (Timothy) culture is in many ways the eternal "business" of the city (Zukin, 1995). With the development of cultural tourism, the cultural objects of tourism have also changed. The pursuit of excellence is accompanied by the pursuit of daily life (Richards, 2011). The United Nations World Tourism Organization defined the meaning of "cultural travel" at the 22nd Congress in Chengdu, China (UNWTO, 2017: 18), confirming that contemporary cultural tourism involves not only sites and monuments, but also lifestyle, creativity and " Everyday Culture "(Richards).
There is little research on daily cultural heritage at home and abroad, and its focus is on the evolution of value and the challenges it faces in urban renewal. In general, the focus shifted from spatial entities to intangible elements such as "urban memory". Related research includes commemorative urban space strategy research based on the dimensions of daily life, pointing out that commemorative spaces are meeting the daily cultural needs of the public, the commemorative benefits are expanding, As well as the promotion of urban renaissance and the cultural benefits of generating profiles (Al-hagla).
In addition, existing studies have revealed that cultural heritage presents common characteristics in the conflicts and changes in the value of past and present. The value of urban cultural heritage has fractured and bi-temporal characteristics on the two time levels of the past and present (Zhang Qi, 2015). Regarding the concept of "daily cultural heritage", there is no uniform definition. Ma Rongjun defined it as the urban heritage that “maintains the ordinary, trivial and continuous gradual” state of daily life, which plays an active role in daily life. It is public, open, frequent, gradual, past value, today value. (Ma Rongjun, 2015)
All in all, the challenges of daily cultural heritage and the exploration of potential vitality both lie in its dual value system of "past value" and "present value": ① "urban memory", which originates from the long-term lifestyle habits of local residents; ②as "urban business card" ", Representing the deep-seated characteristics of the city and satisfying tourists' psychology of hunting.
The relevant analysis methods of urban historical and cultural space research mainly include map overlay analysis method, space syntax, cognitive map method, mapping method, GIS-based and spatial point pattern analysis method, and the traditional methods include the combination of GIS and cognitive map. Such as the spatial location and quality of Guangzhou ’s old city (Li Fan, 2010), and the cognitive structural characteristics of Nanjing ’s Confucius District (Huang Zhenfang, 2016). Today, social media has become a key word-of-mouth medium for people to spread information about their experiences. It has become a trend to combine big data platforms with spatial analysis to study crowd preferences and urban spatial development characteristics. According to different research problems, choose different platforms, read different "fields" as spatial data, and combine statistics and spatial analysis methods to conduct quantitative and qualitative research on the problem. When Dongying Li studies the differences in population use of space and related drivers from a tourism perspective, the location-based tag cloud analyzes the "Flickr" data and visualizes the spatial interaction between tourists and locals through spatial clustering, disparity index, and spatial scan statistics (2018). Many studies are based on POI data to analyze the spatial pattern and spatial relationship of elements (Sinica). This method can also be used for research on a certain type of space. Jinliao He used gis to analyze the point density and employment position entropy LQE of Nanjing Photography Studio, and conducted correlation regression analysis on the interpretation factors such as landscape facilities and accessibility through OLS (2018). For consumer behavior, use review data to use natural language processing (NLP) to study consumer behavior and lifestyle and spatial usage patterns (Rahimi et al.). Regarding urban heritage, there are also related attempts. For example, using "historical city landscape" as a research field, the difference between urban residents and tourists' understanding of the value of the city's historical landscape is drawn through social media, and the "cold spot" historical landscape (Manal Ginzarly) dominated by local people is identified. Data platforms that focus on consumer objects are more targeted.
The domestic food and beverage category includes Meituan and Hungry, etc., the travel category includes Qunar and Ma Honeycomb, and the comprehensive category includes online group purchase platforms such as Dianping. Seongmin Jeon analyzed the "online group purchase" data to study the different consumer behavior ideas and cultural landscape preferences of locals and tourists, including related characters such as price and location, pointing out that local consumers have the highest evaluation of discounts, and visitors may be more concerned Product category (2017). The application of social media in urban research and management services has advantages and potential that cannot be ignored.
Since 2006, the Beijing time-honored brand has gained social attention as an intangible cultural heritage protection. Regarding the value positioning, in the "Opinions on Promoting the Inheritance and Development of Beijing Time-honored Brands" (2018), it is clearly stated that the time-honored brand is the "living fossil" of historical culture and the "gold business card" of international exchanges. The related categories of “Old Brands” focus on skills and folklore (see table). Facing the problems of old city transformation and urban renaissance, the Chinese time-honored brand has lost its foothold in emerging industries. Regarding old shops and old shops, since 2000, Chen Zhanxiang, Wu Liangyong, etc. have put forward a variety of academically valuable insights and realistic viewpoints on "urban renewal". Zhang Jijiao believes that the relationship between urban renaissance, Lao Shang Street and the old restaurant is a three-level relationship of macro, meso and micro, and draws from the experience of the Korean old brand "the successful magic weapon of the old restaurant is to change the culture "Capital", linking commercial value with cultural value at the time-honored brand level (2016). In addition, the research on "Beijing time-honored brand" is mostly a quantitative description of spatial distribution. Zhou Aihua and others used the kernel density estimation method, the nearest neighbor index method, the standard deviation ellipse model and the geographic detector method to analyze the spatial differentiation and influencing factors of the old commercial outlets in Kaifeng City. Zhou Aihua (2015) and others used buffer analysis, kernel density analysis, standard deviation ellipse and other methods to study the spatial distribution characteristics of the old snack shops in Beijing and the factor contribution levels that affect store distribution. Tian Yan and Zhou Shangyi simultaneously used GIS spatial analysis and CrimeStat hot spot analysis to characterize the spatial clustering of Beijing's time-honored brands.
From the four aspects of research structure, region, perspective, and analysis methods, the existing research of "Beijing Time-honored Brand" is described. Dongcheng District and Xicheng District bring together about 90% of Beijing ’s established brands, and the overall distribution structure is as follows: the density gradually decreases from the center to the periphery, and radiates to the Third Ring Road and beyond (Tian Yan, 2015). In terms of categories, there are many studies on catering, and the research area is mostly limited to the sixth district of Beijing City, because 88% of the well-established stores are located here (Lei Yan, 2017). Lei Yan and Xu Peiwei tried to study Beijing's established brands from the perspective of big data. For the first time, based on the data of Dadianping.com, they studied consumer online evaluation. In particular, when researching the present distribution, Tian Yan compared with the spatial distribution characteristics of Beijing's old time-honored brands during the Qing Dynasty, and found that the concentration of old time-honored brands has decreased, and the level of agglomerated areas that they rely on has decreased. It can be seen that existing studies have clearly stated the spatial quantity and distribution characteristics of established shops, and have initially explored the commercial value of “old shops”. However, the spatial research of "Beijing Time-honored Brands" has not yet combined quantitative and qualitative issues, and it did not further describe the specific heritage assets or cultural values ​​generated by the interaction between "Old Time-brands" and users, which is closely related to the dynamic mechanism of "Old Time-brands".



\3. Study area and data
3.1 Study area
Beijing is the capital of China. It is a world-famous ancient capital and a modern international city. It is rich in cultural heritage and is also facing the problem of heritage protection brought by urban construction. This coexistence of internationalization and ancient capital also gave birth to the problem of "daily transformation" of urban heritage in the context of the times. The Ministry of Commerce has currently identified 1,128 well-established brands, of which there are 117 "Chinese well-known brands" (hereinafter referred to as well-established brands) in Beijing ’s sub-city, second only to Shanghai (180), considering that mastering local knowledge is conducive to analysis and Judging, we choose the more familiar Beijing as the research area. (As table 1)

![t2.jpg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f0806e_2073749e437c40f681050e6d42e3dd04~mv2.jpg/v1/crop/x_0,y_63,w_777,h_314/fill/w_600,h_242,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/t2.jpg)

Table.1 Number of Time-Honored Brand in every province of China

3.2 Research data acquisition: Obtain a list of well-established brands: Obtain a list of Beijing ’s well-established brands through the unified platform of the Ministry of Commerce ’s business system, China ’s Well-established Brand Information Platform (http://zhlzh.mofcom.gov.cn/), and extract relevant company names and registered trademark information. Classification is shown in Table 1. There are a total of 117 Chinese old-time brands in Beijing (including 67 in the first batch and 50 in the second batch), of which 23 are retail, 43 are catering, 33 are food processing, 5 are medicine, 5 are handicrafts, and 8 are other (Table 2).

![t3.jpg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f0806e_1ffadece41d9490c8eb20e18ef38cedb~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_935,h_420,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/t3.jpg)

Table.2 117 Beijing Time-Honored Brand

Screening of time-honored brands: Then we screened all the time-honored brands. Not all old brands have material space related to daily life, that is, not all old brands have daily nature, such as "Wang Zhihe", which is a long-established food processing brand mainly based on fermented bean curd products, but it does not have any Stores or other physical spaces have a relationship with residents, but are related to the daily lives of residents through distributors such as supermarkets, so they do not meet the daily characteristics. We combined the search results of map poi and Dianping.com to delete 37 similar old brands with no physical space, including Longshuncheng Chinese-style furniture factory, Xuelian Cashmere Co., Ltd., etc. and obtained further data that can represent everydayness. The list of old brands, such as Table 4. Among them, the selected catering brands accounted for 67.4% of Beijing's well-established catering brands, and other categories accounted for 62.5%, as shown in Table 3. The selected brands have wide coverage, representativeness, and a reasonable proportion.

![t1.jpg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f0806e_127395a8e5eb4a56ad2e463e610a994f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_532,h_402,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/t1.jpg)

Fig.1 Data Data filtering results

Store information and screening: Almost all old brands have branches. As shown in Figure x, Tongrentang has 349 branches. Since each branch has its geographic entity, we need to obtain data for each branch. Next, we use web crawlers to obtain information about all the well-established shops and branches in Table 2. The obtained information includes the name of the shop, the latitude and longitude of the shop, the id of the shop (the unique id from the public comment), the star of the shop, the label of the shop, and the number of reviews. A total of about 2,000 stores from 80 well-established stores have been obtained. Among all the acquired store information, not all stores have enough review information to provide us with a basis for judging the daily nature of the store. For example, among all the stores in "Tongrentang", only 7 stores have more than 100 reviews and more than 100 The number of reviews in each store is 0, and the number of reviews presents a heavy-tailed distribution. In other stores with a large number of branches, such as Wu Yutai and Emei Restaurant, the same distribution trend also exists. For many branches that have almost no reviews, we cannot individually evaluate their daily size. Here we only study stores with more than 50 reviews. According to the scale and vitality, we selected 461 stores and constructed a well-established data set that is much smaller than the actual number of public comment poi points.

Comment user information: After obtaining all the store information, we have obtained the information of the review users of each store through the web crawler, including the user name of the review user, the user's attribution, the number of user fans, the number of user interactions, and the registration time, And community level. A total of about 250,000 pieces of user data information were finally obtained.

3.3 Research methods—Establishment of consumer group structure modelAccording to the four fields of store name, user attribution, total number of comments, and latitude and longitude, a consumer group structure model is constructed spatially. The popularity value of the time-honored brand originates from locals and tourists, and the preferences of the two types of consumer groups reflect the dual value system of the time-honored brand. Therefore, when studying the structure of consumer groups, it is necessary to consider the proportion of locals and the total number of reviews. The locals go to the old brands for consumption for a variety of reasons, including their nostalgia, a sense of life rituals, or taking relatives and friends to experience the old brands, which are closely related to the daily habits of residents. The proportion of local consumers can objectively reflect the regularity of established brands, which we call the dailyity index. Our construction of the daily index (D) is based on a fairly intuitive logic:

D = p / n

Among them, the number of local consumers is p; the total number of reviews is n, which is the popularity value of the old brand. On the basis of a certain amount of data, the higher the proportion of locals who consume in the store, the stronger its daily nature. According to the attributes of the time-honored brand, the time-honored brand used to serve the daily needs of local residents, that is, the daily index approached 1. The specific approach is (Figure 2): First, analyze the numerical structure of the store; second, put the store information on the space, describe the distribution characteristics of the old brand based on the structure of the consumer; finally discuss and speculate through horizontal space comparison The relationship between the time-honored brand classification and the popularity of city attractions and business districts.

\4. Main results

4.1 Structural characteristics of consumers and classification differences

Calculate the acquired "dailyness index" and "heat value" of 461 well-established stores one by one. We use the natural discontinuous grading method (jenks) to classify the daily index and the heat separately. It is achieved by minimizing the average deviation in the same group and maximizing the average deviation in different groups. Considering that 85% of the stores are above 0.6, so we will adjust the daily level to:

Level 1- (0.90-1)

Level 2- (0.81-0.90)

Level 3- (0.71-0.80)

Level 4- (0.61-0.70)

Level 5- (0-0.60)

On the heat value, because 95% of the total number of store reviews is below 4000, the heat rating index is divided into

Level 1- (above 4001)

Level 2- (02001-4000)

Level 3- (1001-2000)

Level 4- (401-1000)

Level 5- (50-400)

Calculate the average daily index of different brands according to the value of the merchant. Among the six types of time-honored brands, other categories (photographers, barbershops, and vegetable markets) have a higher daily routine, followed by medicine, and the overall daily routine of catering. The daily nature of crafts, retail, and food are low. From high to low, as shown in Table 3, it shows that local people's preference for brands has nothing to do with whether they have “non-heritage items” or “technology.” The daily indicators are distributed between 0.2-1, and there are 10 brands with 0.9 or more More than 18.87%, mainly catering and other categories; 16 from 0.80-0.90; 13 from 0.70-0.80; 6 from 0.60-0.70; 5 from 0.50-0.60; only 3 from 0.50 to 0.60It can be seen that most brands maintain a high degree of daily life, and maintain a high degree of fit with the residents' living habits; there is a significant difference in the daily classification among brands.

4.2 Spatial distribution characteristics of consumer structure

The nuclear density analysis method is used to reflect the overall spatial distribution difference of Beijing's old-fashioned shops (Figure 3). The results show that the inner city has high agglomeration, and the number decreases from the inner city to the outside. Some gathering areas; Qianmen Dashilan area is highly concentrated, the Wangfujing area is more concentrated, and there is continuous aggregation around Gulou Street, Xisi, Changchun Bridge, and other places. We found 18 clustered areas of shops based on the density and number of spatial distributions of the shops. Visualize the spatial distribution characteristics of daily index and heat value separately, and focus on the characteristics of the high concentration area of shops. In addition, 82% is distributed in the fifth ring, so we will focus on this part in the following analysis.

Fig.3 Research methods and roadmap

4.2.1 Geographical distribution characteristics of daily index

Visualize the daily index in space, using 1000m as the grid unit and 1km as the unit to calculate the average daily index of the grid area. (Figure 4) On the whole, the high daily value of the long-established shops is concentrated in the southeast and north of the Forbidden City, but also in the northeast and southwest of the city, but the scale is not large. In the inner city, the daily index of long-established brands is mixed, the overall is low, and the outside is high. The inner city is inlaid with areas with high Ping'anli Street-West Fourth, Beixinqiao, East Fourth, and Flower Market.

4.2.2 Geographical distribution characteristics of heat values

Using the same visualization method, calculate the heat value index of the grid area(Figure 5). The total number of reviews of most shops is low, basically below 1000; there are areas with higher heat around the Forbidden City, and the high values are generally distributed from northwest to southeast, and most of the extremely high values are distributed in the northwestern Haidian District, such as Jinyuan and Peking University Outer and Wudaokou areas, in addition, Chaoyang Joy City at the east fifth ring road of the city has extremely high reviews; other high-value areas are scattered.

In order to further explore the spatial distribution characteristics, when we conducted an autocorrelation analysis on the daily index and the heat value, we found that the daily index of the merchant has a positive correlation(Figure 6) with the daily index of the surrounding merchants (Z value is 5.21); the heat distribution pattern is random The differences between the modes are similar (z = -0.78). Therefore, we need to discuss the regularity and popularity of old brands by region.

4.2.3 Characteristics of high-growth areas of old brands 

First, qualitatively describe old brands with average daily sex index and heat value. The 18 high-aggregation areas are attached to the characteristics of two indexes. From the scatter distribution (Figure 6), it can be seen that the aggregation area is divided into four major categories and 12 minor categories in the quadrant.

After that, we analyze the relationship between the partition average and store variance. The results show that different daily sex indexes have different numerical distribution characteristics. In areas with a lower average index, shops tend to have larger variances. For example, the Wangfujing area has an average value of 0.58 and a variance of 0.24. The area contains extremely high and extremely low values.

![p5.jpg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f0806e_85c4d1569a16437697062d0f8317fd98~mv2.jpg/v1/crop/x_0,y_42,w_2133,h_1250/fill/w_815,h_478,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/p5.jpg)

Fig.7 Everydayness Index-Popularity scatter plot

Secondly, in order to better describe the spatial distribution characteristics of the daily index from the characteristics of the store distribution, we divided the stores into 5 levels according to the daily index and conducted a nuclear density analysis. (As shown in Figures 8 and 9) On the whole, the extremely high-value distribution of the daily index is more uniform, and the extremely low-value distribution is more concentrated, mostly in the second ring; the distribution of the shops with the daily level of 60% -90% is the inner city Centralized, scattered outside the city. Among them, the daily indexes of Dashilan, Wangfujing, and Gulou Streets are distributed at all levels. There is no low daily distribution of Ping'anli-Xisi-West Monolithic Area and Fuchengmenwai Avenue, Jinyuan, Beixinqiao Area, and Dahongmen; The characteristics of other regions are relatively random; the thermal core density analysis charts of various levels show that the thermal spatial aggregation is poor. Only extremely high heat values have significant aggregation in the Jinyuan area.

Fig.9 Popularity of 5 levels

Based on the above spatial distribution characteristics, old brands can be divided into 4 categories, the specific characteristics are as follows:

\1) High daily life-high heat: Hepingmen, Ping'anli-Xisi-Xidan, Fuchengmenwai Avenue, Shuangjing. The well-established shops in these areas are recognized by consumers, among which locals account for more The large proportion is still retained in the choice of local residents' daily habits; among them, there are also shops with extremely low daily nature in Ping'anli-Xisi-Xidan and Fuchengmenwai Avenue.

\2) High daily nature-low heat: Beixinqiao, Jinyuan, Beitucheng, Flower Market, Dongsi, Dahongmen, Caishikou Department Store Center, its heat is mainly derived from local people, but failed to attract as a city business card More tourists

\3) Low everydayness-high fever: Chongwenmen, Dashilan, Qianmen, Wangfujing, and Gulou Streets, respectively. Although not the usual choices of locals, they have a large number of tourists and consumers as city business cards.

\4) Low daily life-low heat: West passenger station and South Street, respectively, can be seen from the heat value. The well-established shops in these areas do not belong to the locals' preference, and the source of vitality is a small number of tourists.

4.3 Influencing factors of the spatial distribution

The well-established shops have the dual attributes of business and tourism. For their spatial distribution, we infer that they have certain relevance to commercial hotspots (popular commercial districts) and tourist hotspots (popular attractions). In order to verify the relationship between the daily nature of the time-honored brand and popular commercial districts and attractions, we obtained 150 popular scenic spots in Beijing and their review data and 29 popular commercial districts for analysis.

4.3.1 Top attractions

First of all, we put the scenic spot review data on a 1km * 1km grid and use the review data to characterize the popularity of scenic spots. As shown in Figure 10, the hottest areas are the Jingshan, Tiananmen and other areas on the north and south sides of the Forbidden City, followed by a high concentration near Beixin Bridge, and other hot spots are scattered.

Overlapping the old-time-gathering areas and the heat maps of the attractions, it was found that most of the old-time-gathering areas were in a state of non-coincidence with popular attractions. Only a small number of areas such as Gulou Street, Wangfujing, Qianmen Dashilan area, and Beixinqiao area overlapped the distribution of old time-honored points and attractions. In these overlapping areas, the daily nature of the shops is low, that is, the number of tourists in these areas due to the number of tourists brought by popular attractions has increased. The Beixinqiao area is relatively special, and its daily life is relatively high, but the popularity of its well-established shops is relatively low, which may be related to its regional nature. The main attraction of the Beixinqiao area is Yonghe Temple, which is different from the other three consumer areas. This area is mainly for religious activities, etc., which may be more relevant to the daily lives of residents.

4.3.2 Popular business district

Commercial districts, also known as commercial centers, shopping streets, commercial districts, and bustling streets, refer to the city ’s combination of shops, shopping malls, restaurants, office buildings, hotels and other commercial facilities, plus streets, stations, pedestrian streets and other public facilities. The completed area is the main essence and downtown area in the city. Larger cities will have multiple business districts of different sizes. We obtained its definition of the central location of Beijing ’s popular business district from Dadianping. The radius is used as a buffer zone to characterize the scope of the business district. Figure 9 shows that most of the business districts of Beijing are distributed in the east and north, as well as around the inner city, and the south city is less distributed.

Superimposed the scope of the business district with the distribution area of old brands, and found that some of the distribution of old brands coincides with the business district, such as Yuanda Road, Qianmen Dashilan, Chaowai Street, Wangfujing, etc. Most of the remaining parts are adjacent to the business district but do not overlap, only a small number of old brands are distributed It is completely out of the business circle, such as West Railway Station, Caishikou, Dahongmen area.

Superimposed the daily index of the time-honored brands in the business zone buffer (Figure 10). It was found that in the eastern part of the city, the extremely low part of the daily life is very significantly related to the distribution of the business circle, and the areas with the extremely low daily life are mostly distributed in the business circle. Inside, such as Yansha, Gongti, Chaowai, Wangfujing, Jianguomen, etc. The situation of the Yuanda Road business district outside the Third Ring Road is special. It coincides with the distribution area of the old brand, but the daily index is very high. The conjecture may be related to the business district of the Yuanda Road business district belonging to a lower level.

\5. Conclusion

\1) The daily nature of Beijing time-honored brands has changed a lot. Some shops still maintain a high daily nature, such as Caishikou, Dabei Photo Studio, and Silian Hairdressing, etc., which have the strongest relationship with daily life; some shops The daily nature of the products has been greatly reduced, such as Quanjude, Fengdufeng, and barbecue season. Among all the well-established shops, the daily nature of others, medicine, catering is relatively high, while the daily nature of retail, food, and crafts is relatively low.

In terms of spatial distribution, Beijing time-honored brands are mainly concentrated in 18 areas including Qianmen Dashilan and Wangfujing and are also scattered in other areas. On the whole, the high values of the daily index are concentrated in the southeast and north of the Forbidden City, and also in the northeast and southwest of the city, but the scale is not large. In the inner city, the daily index of the long-established brand is mixed, but the overall index is low, and the outside city is relatively large. High, the inner city is inlaid with the higher areas of Ping'anli Street-West Fourth, Beixinqiao, East Fourth, and Flower Market.

\2) The heat distribution is mainly concentrated around the Forbidden City, and the high heat as a whole shows a northwest-southeast distribution, and most of the extremely high values are distributed in the northwestern Haidian area.

\3) According to the two indicators of the popularity and daily index of Beijing time-honored brands, the 18 districts in which Beijing time-honored brands are concentrated are divided into four categories, namely high-daily and high-heat areas, high-daily and low-heat areas, and low-daily and high-level Hot areas, low daily heat and low heat areas; high daily heat and high heat areas are mainly distributed around the inner city, including Hepingmen, Anli Road, Ping'anli-Xisi-Xidan, Fuchengmenwai Avenue, Shuangjing area, high The daily low heat is Beixinqiao, Jinyuan, Beitucheng, Flower Market, Dongsi, Dahongmen, Caishikou Department Store Center, the low daily heat is Chongwenmen, Qianmen Dashilan, Wangfujing, Gulou Street, The ones with low daily routine and low fever are West Passenger Station and South Street.

\4) In each area where old brands are concentrated, there is an obvious negative correlation between the regional everydayness and the difference in the everydayness of the stores in the area. That is, the lower the regional everydayness, the greater the difference in the everydayness of the stores in the area. For example, in the Dashilan area of Qianmen, there are shops with a low daily routine index of around 0.3, and some stores with high daily index and 0.8 exist; and in areas with high regional daily routines, the daily routine difference of the old shop Smaller.

\5) The distribution of old time-honored brands and the overall popularity of hot spots present a mutually complementary distribution status. In the coincident area, the daily life of old time-honored brands is generally low, that is, the daily nature of old time-honored brands is greatly affected by tourist hotspots. Most of them are distributed within or along the border of the business district, and only a few independent business districts are distributed; in the eastern part of the city, the daily nature of the old brands distributed in the business district is at a very low level, that is, popular businessmen in the east The circle also affects the daily nature of the time-honored brand.

 

\6. Discussion

There are still several deficiencies in this article. 

The first one is the lack of research data. The public comment data has certain limitations.

\1) Users do not represent the entire crowd, mainly young people.

\2) Tourists will be more inclined to use public comments for comments.

\3) Different types of time-honored brands may have different degrees of attention, and catering is more likely to be reviewed than retail.

Secondly, the construction of the time-honored index of the time-honored brand is still slightly thin. The tourist-local ratio is only a basic characteristic of the time-honored brand. The difference between the popularity of working days and the proportion of tourists.

Finally, based on the public review data, the daily construction of the old brands is indexed, the geographical distribution characteristics are described, and the related factors are analyzed at the end. To further explain such aspects as reachability.
